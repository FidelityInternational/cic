<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This course is intended to teach good practices around Infrastructure-as-Code development. This course contains a set of materials which are designed to teach you how to write tests for and automate the release of the things you build.</p>

<p>To undertake this course you will need a computer which you have full control over (i.e not your employer&#39;s desktop build) - It will need to be on a network with unrestricted access to the Internet (not behind locked-down corporate firewalls) as you will need to download and install a few components before you can begin.</p>

<p>Topics covered in this material:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='const'>Available</span> <span class='label'>Tracks:</span>
 <span class='id identifier rubyid_ansible'>ansible</span>
<span class='id identifier rubyid_continuous_integration'>continuous_integration</span>
</code></pre>

<p>To remove the need for dependencies on an external IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) solution in order to participate in this course, this course has been designed to use Docker containers to simulate real computers.</p>

<p>The course is being actively built out so be sure to <code>git pull</code> regularly to get new exercises as they appear.</p>

<h2>Participants</h2>

<h3>Environment Requirements</h3>

<p>For this material you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Bash compatible environment</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>Docker - If you don&#39;t have it already, follow the instructions on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/#next-release">Docker website</a> to install it on your system</li>
<li>Editor of your choice</li>
<li>A browser</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<ol>
<li>create a .netrc file in your home directory with your credentials for github in it.
Your entry should look something like this:
<code>
machine api.github.com
  login &lt;username&gt;
  password &lt;password&gt;
</code></li>
<li>Fork this repo</li>
<li>Clone your fork: <code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;youruser&gt;/&lt;fork&gt;.git cic</code></li>
<li>cd in to your checkout: <code>cd cic</code></li>
<li>setup the courseware: <code>./bin/setup</code></li>
</ol>

<h3>Starting a learning track</h3>

<p>To see the Learning tracks that CIC contains run: <code>cic track list</code>
This will output the following</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='const'>Available</span> <span class='label'>Tracks:</span>
 <span class='id identifier rubyid_ansible'>ansible</span>
<span class='id identifier rubyid_continuous_integration'>continuous_integration</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Start a track by running the <code>cic track start</code> command
E.g. <code>cic track start ansible --fork youruser/fork-name</code></p>

<p>This creates a project in Github to guide you through the track and outputs its URL</p>

<p>Got the the url and you&#39;ll see that there is a project board waiting for you. This board contains tickets for each of the exercises that you should complete to cover the topic you have chosen.</p>

<p>The board will allow you to track and share progress. When you complete an exercise, raise a pull request on your own fork to and get feedback from a peer to ensure you are getting the most from the exercise.</p>

<h3>Individual exercises</h3>

<p>The exercises can be found inside the exercises folder. For each exercise there is a README.md which explains what is required. If you don&#39;t want to sit a whole learning track but want to brush up on something in particular, exercises can be found inside the exercises folder. For each exercise there is a README.md which explains what is required.</p>
