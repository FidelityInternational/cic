# CI/CD Bootcamp
## Introduction
Welcome to the CI/CD/IaC Bootcamp. The Bootcamp is a set of materials designed to teach you how to write tests for and automate the release of the things you build.

## What's in the Bootcamp
The course is being actively built out so be sure to pull regularly to get new exercises as they appear.
### Infrastructure as code
#### Ansible
#### Testing
## Getting Started
### Environment Requirements
For this material you will need the following: 
 - a *nix type environment
 - Ruby
 - Docker
 - git
 - Editor of your choice

 To help with the *nix, Ruby and Docker requirements, a Vagrantfile and setup scripts are provided. See 'Setting Up' below for help.
 
### Setting Up 
0. Install Vagrant
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/lvl-up/ci-cd-training.git`
2. cd in to checkout: `cd ci-cd-training`
3. `vagrant up`
4. `vagrant ssh`
3. `cd /vagrant && source ./bin/setup`

Note: this Vagrantfile assumes you're using the 'virtualbox' provider. If you want to use a different provider, you'll need to modify the Vagrantfile before running `vagrant up`.
