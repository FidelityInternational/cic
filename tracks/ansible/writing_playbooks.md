Now that you have had a basic introduction to Ansible and playbooks it's time to role your sleeves up and learn the basics of how to write a playbook for yourself.

In this exercise we'll go through what a playbook is in more detail as well as how it hangs together. 

As with most of the exercises from here on in, there is a challenge at the end of the exercise test what you've learnt.

**Note:** Feedback is an important part of learning. If you have people supporting you on this course, do this exercise on a separate branch so that you can raise a pull request against your own fork and get someone to review it.
