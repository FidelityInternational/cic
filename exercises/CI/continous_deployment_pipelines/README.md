## Introduction
Continuous integration is an important step in ensuring that code is of good quality and works as intended, however well tested code isn't worth much if it's not released and bringing value to users.

Continuous deployment is, as the name suggest, the practice of automating the release of software as soon as it's verified to be ready.

It may sound obvious to say but releasing software when it's ready is increadibly important

When a new product is built it is the result of a lot of hard work. E.g. analysis, programming and testing. However until a product is released to it's target audience, all of that effort can be considered waste activity as it is for nothing unless a release happens. Often a new version of a product contains new features that are based on assumptions as to what users want and how they will want to use it. Those assumptions can be tested until the product is in users hand's and they are actually using it. Getting feedback on new features is key to driving requirements for subsequent releases. Companies that are able to release software very frequently put themselves at a huge advantage, when compared to competitors who are unable to do so, because they are able to:
- react more quickly
- get feedback more frequently
- de-risk the release process by making each release small

## Learning Objectives
- Learn the features of Concourse that enable building continuous deployment pipelines
- Use concourse ci to setup a continous deployment pipeline

## Useful Terminology
`# Optional - any key terms you intend to use in your exercise, if appropriate, could be listed here`

## Required prequisite knowledge
- basic knowledge of Concourse CI:
  You know how to use the Concourse command line interface (CLI) to:
    - Login
    - Create and trigger pipelines
    - Navigate the user interface.
- Appreciation of continuous integration
Don't worry if you need to brush up on either of these things, take a look at the [Introduction to CI]() exercise to get up to speed.
